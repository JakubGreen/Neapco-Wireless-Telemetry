# Neapco-Wireless-Telemetry
This repository was created to act as a collaborative effort between Neapco LLC. and students from various university engineering teams. The idea is to work hand in hand with students to develop an open source Telemetry platform capable of helping students both learn and understand concepts of data acquisition and implementation of electronic hardware.
